Description of the branch
---------------------------

This branch contains the game itself with all the interfaces.

Monster and player attributes should be balanced.

Monster frequencies per level should be balanced.

Player leveling up should be balanced.

Game mechanics like applying toughness, leveling up, increase attributes when consuming an item... should work but they are not properly unit-tested.

When resuming the project, start with issue number #147
