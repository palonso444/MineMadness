Description of current code
---------------------------

This is a complete beta-version mechanic-wise but it is not properly balanced, tested and debugged.
There is no guarantee that mechanics function well!!
More monsters must be created (special ones).
Only rock walls are in this version. Granite or Quarz walls are implemented but need to be included in the
game_progression() function of game.stats.py
