Description of the branch
---------------------------

This branch contains the game itself with all the interfaces.

Monster and player attributes are already balanced.

Monster frequencies per level are already balanced.

Player leveling up is already balanced.

Game mechanics like applying toughness, leveling up, increase attributes when consuming an item... should work but they are not properly unit-tested.
